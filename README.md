## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CatalinButacu/OCS_FRAMEWORK.git
   cd TUIASI_OCS_TEAM11_2025
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   On **Windows**:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On **macOS/Linux**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Install the framework in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This ensures that changes to the framework code are reflected immediately.

## Usage

### Running Examples

To run the example scripts located in the `examples` folder, use the following command:
```bash
python examples/example_canonical_ga.py
```

### Developing with the Framework

You can import the framework in your scripts like this:
```python
from framework.algorithms.canonical_ga import CGA, CGAAdaptiveV2, CGAGreedy
```
